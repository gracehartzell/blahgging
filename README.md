# My Blog 
This is a repository that will eventually become a blogsite or personal site for me. As I go on, I expect the 
structure to change and will document my progress as such. I've started keeping somewhat detailed notes (albeit 
sporadic) of what I've learned and how my learning has gone. It's also a good platform for me to practice writing 
out an ideal layout/style for markdown files so you don't have to constantly side-scroll (personal peeve). Follow
along as I treat Github like my therapist and learning coach!
